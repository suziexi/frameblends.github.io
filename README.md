## Welcome to FrameBlends Project 

This project is developed by Wenyue Xi (Suzie) for Google Summer of Code 2020 with Red Hen Lab

### Description 
1. For the project idea "AI Recognizers of Frame Blends, Especially in Conversations About the Future," my proposal aims to create a semantic tagging system to classify different time frames in the conversation in the form of text or video record. Ideally, this system can classify the situation where human beings imagine a future by blending the present with incompatible frames. The project will be based on some of the existed algorithms, frameworks, and databases, and also choose and integrate them carefully to accomplish the goal. This system will also create an interactive system that allows humans to manually mark the false positive and true negative and keep re-training the data with such human manipulation. In each round of training, the system will consider the manual marks, and eventually reach the stage when the system is able to mark the desired portion as accurate as possible. When the source data is large enough, the tagging system of the blended frame also allows us to make the unnoticed connections between current and past social conditions to gain inspiration to solve the real-world problem, or provide more evidence to the anthropological and historical studies.
